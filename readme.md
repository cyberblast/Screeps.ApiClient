This is a client for the screeps API, inspired by [screepers/python-screeps](https://github.com/screepers/python-screeps) (thank you for the great [documentation](https://github.com/screepers/python-screeps/blob/master/docs/Endpoints.md)!).  

Each method will return a [dynamic object](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/csharp/language-reference/keywords/dynamic), having just those properties which the json response from screeps server API contains. You will need to know yourself which properties are present and which aren't, because there are no Data Contracts defined anywhere for Serialization. But you can access present properties as if you were using a Data Contract.

Like this: 
```C#
Client client = new Client(email, password);
dynamic me = client.Me();
Console.Write("User {0}, GCL: {1}", me.username, me.gcl);
```
This way, the client is resistant to future changes of screeps API responses. But you may need to adjust your consumer in those cases!  

For your convenience, there is an inline documentation of how current responses are structured (according to documentation from screepers/python-screeps). It should also give you intellisense hints.
```C#
/// <summary>
/// Information about logged in user
/// </summary>
/// <returns>{ ok, _id, email, username, cpu, badge: { type, color1, color2, color3, param, flip }, password, notifyPrefs: { sendOnline, errorsInterval, disabledOnMessages, disabled, interval }, gcl, credits, lastChargeTime, lastTweetTime, github: { id, username }, twitter: { username, followers_count } }</returns>
public dynamic Me()
```
